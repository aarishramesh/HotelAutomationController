Hotel Automation Controller 

Hello! This is a simple Maven Java project implementing the assignment on Hotel Automation Controller from Sahaj Software

Major part of the implementation is dervied from https://github.com/asgs/hotel-automation-controller

Few important briefings about the implementation

1. Implementation takes into into multiple sensor inputs at a time i.e concurrency wrt sensor inputs have been handled

2. Only the Night slot is taken into account. However, the code can slightly be modified to take that into account as well, if need be.

3. All user inputs are followed by pressing the Return key.

4. Unit tests for Main class is avoided (intentionally).

5. The final Jar can be generated by running the command 'mvn clean package'. To run the jar, the command 'java -jar hotel-automation-controller-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar' can be run from the target directory.

6. Find-bugs check have been integrated into the project. If find-bugs report high priority bugs then this will result in build failure

7. External dependencies are the use of project lombok's @Data annotations for code readability sake
